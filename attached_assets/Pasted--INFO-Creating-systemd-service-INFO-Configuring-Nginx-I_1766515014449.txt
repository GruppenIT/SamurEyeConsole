Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.app.samureye.com.br.

with the following value:

tRGOBBYbYZi3iRwXOf8cA96Cr6oqpjWYAYROBkKqr34

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.app.samureye.com.br.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: manual). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: app.samureye.com.br
  Type:   dns
  Detail: DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up TXT for _acme-challenge.app.samureye.com.br - check that a DNS record exists for this domain

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to verify the manually created DNS TXT records. Ensure that you created these in the correct location, or try waiting longer for DNS propagation on the next attempt.

Some challenges have failed.
Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
[WARN] Certbot DNS challenge failed or was skipped.
[WARN] To get SSL certificate later, run:
[WARN]   sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d app.samureye.com.br
[WARN] Then configure Nginx with the certificate.
